# Image Classification Predictor

This repository contains a Streamlit application for predicting image classifications using a pre-trained Keras model.

## Repository Structure

```
app.py
Final_CODEMONK.ipynb
final_model.keras
temp.jpg
data


## Requirements

To install the required dependencies, run:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Application

To run the Streamlit application, use the following command:

```sh
streamlit run app.py
```

## Usage

1. Upload an image using the file uploader.
2. Click the "Predict" button to get the predicted labels for the uploaded image.

## Files

- `app.py`: Main application file containing the Streamlit UI and prediction logic.
- `Final_CODEMONK.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with additional code and experiments.
- `final_model.keras`: Pre-trained Keras model used for predictions.
- `temp.jpg`: Temporary file to store the uploaded image.
- `data/`: Directory containing sample images for testing.
